Yo! This is the README.
This is my project for web fundamentals, fall 2024. It took me about 8 weeks to build.
I really came to enjoy building websites here on this project. It's personal to me, and I've been in person to some of these trails. 
Anyways, the images, scripts, styles, and trails folders should be self-explanatory. I intend to work more on this site when I learn some more javascript or maybe XML and XML DOM to build a comment section.
