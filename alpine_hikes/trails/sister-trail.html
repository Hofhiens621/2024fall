                <div id="details">
                    <p>Length: 2.1 miles</p>
                    <p>Time: 30 minutes</p>

                <p>This trail makes for a perfect trail run. It has one or two steep areas that are only a few meters long, and is flat most of the way outside of that. Most of the trail is forested with moderate sunshine, having lots of pine and aspen trees. During fall, there are many chokecherry and serviceberry bushes that are edible and quite tasty. The trail can also be done by snowshoe during the winter. Taking the Jordan Canyon road back down is a lot sunnier and a good way to make the trail into a loop.</p>
                <p>It is common to see deer and moose also frequent the area. Be cautious and bring wildlife deterrent. Despite that, I still take my dog with me and don't worry about being chased by a moose.</p>
